If you take a look at where the tithe is supposed to be given, you run into even more problems.  The first two 10 percents are supposed to be saved for a special feast which will be enjoyed by...the family who supplied it.  Not given to a church, or a temple, or a priest, but consumed by the very people who &quot;donated&quot; it.  In fact, the Bible is very specific in stating that if the food won&#x27;t keep on the journey, you sell the tenth of your harvest so that you can buy &quot;whatever you want&quot; to celebrate in Jerusalem. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="31"><p data-reactid="32"> The final 10%, the one collected every third year, is supposed to be directly distributed to the people who have no means of supporting themselves:  the Levites (which includes the priests), illegal immigrants, widows and orphans.

Now, I don&#x27;t hear of any churches - not EVER - saying that we need to be donating 10% of every third year&#x27;s income to illegal immigrants, even though THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="33"><p data-reactid="34">So, factoring in what Jesus said about our image and what Paul says about giving cheerfully, it appears that the Biblical standard for money is to cheerfully, unreluctantly, give everything we have or will ever acquire the moment God requires it of us.  It is no longer a rule, there is no handy percentage that we can simply  check off a list.  In fact, there never was a percentage!  We can no longer rely on a set, predetermined value of how much money to give away.


So how do we determine what is right?  Is 10% good, or is it 5%, or 30%?  To find out, we must engage in a relationship with God on a day-to-day basis to determine what he is asking of us for that day, whether we are to give everything away or safely invest it, or something in between. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="35"><p data-reactid="36">The Biblical standard for giving is not 10%, it&#x27;s personal relationship with God. </p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="37"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="38"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="39"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="40"><span data-reactid="41"><!-- react-empty: 42 --><h2 data-reactid="43"><a data-reactid="44">Thinking Christian Beta</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="45"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="46"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="47"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="48"></div></section></div></div>
